This is a website my friend and I created in 2018. The objective was to create a program that would take in any input and output a list of all possible english words or anagrams one could create. (For example, "jdciatier" would output "cat" and "rat" and ... etc) We also implemented a dictionary and thesaurus function and a login function that kept track of history. The website is not fully functioning right now because the API key that was used is now out of service. This was our first time using Github and, while we did not use the site as we progressed, I have uploaded the final product.
