        Who Are We?
    </h1>
    <p>
        We are two of Mr. Brooks' (the greatest CS teacher) students, Joshua Kim and Anthony Poon.
        Joshua was responsible for the majority of the HTML (the visuals) and Anthony was responsible 
        for the majority of the PYTHON (the actually hard part).

        About The Project
    </h1>
    <p>
        This project was inspired by word games such as Wordscape, Words With Friends, and Scrabble.
        We both have played and continue to play these games and this site is able to help with these types of games 
       (It's not cheating if it's computer science).
    </p>
<br>
<p>
        The main feature of the site is the ability to input any random set of letters and get a list of every word that
        can be made from those letters. By clicking on the words, you can also get their definition and synonyms. There are several
        filters which allow you to narrow down the word you are looking for through the number of letters (less than, greater than, only) or 
        by specific letters in the word (first letter is 'a', second is 'b', etc). If you already know the word you are looking for, you can
        also look it up if you just want the definition or synonyms.
</p>
<br>
<p>
        We also have a very nice register and login feature. This is very useful because users who register and login will have their search history
        saved. An extra feature which may add to your convenience is the top navigation bar which allows you to return home, search for new words, 
        and more without having to press the 'back button' all the time. We hope you enjoy our site. <a href="unscramble.html">Have fun!</a>
